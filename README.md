# Asciimate
Asciimate is a tool for animating ASCII art, and is based on the web.

## Features:
### Settings:
Currently, settings can only be
accessed on the creation of a
project.

You can set the dimensions of the canvas; and the amount of frames and layers.
### Canvas:
The canvas is where you draw your ASCII art. It has a fixed width and a height
### Insert Mode: 
Insert mode allows you to insert text onto the canvas and type the text out like in a normal
text editor.

Use the checkbox labeled "Insert" to turn it on and off. Click once on the canvas to set its position, and then type out your text. Press Alt+Enter to confirm.
### Brush Mode:
When insert mode is disabled, you can paint with characters. Scroll wheel to change brush size. Hover over the canvas or the 'Character' box to set the
character.
### Animation & Layering
Use the arrow keys to navigate the animation timeline. Transparency in layers counts as the space character. The 'Play' checkbox plays back your animation when checked.
